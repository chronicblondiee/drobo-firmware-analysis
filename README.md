## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
```bash
# Install analysis tools
sudo apt-get install binwalk hexdump python3 build-essential
pip3 install binwalk

# Optional: Ghidra for advanced analysis
# Download from: https://ghidra-sre.org/
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Extract Firmware Components
```bash
# From scripts/extraction/ directory
cd scripts/extraction/
python3 extract_all_components.py [firmware_file.tdf]
```

### 2. Analyze for Patch Targets
```bash
# From scripts/analysis/ directory  
cd scripts/analysis/
python3 find_patch_targets.py
```

### 3. Apply 2TB Limit Patch
```bash
# From scripts/patching/ directory
cd scripts/patching/
python3 patch_2tb_limit.py
```

## Detailed Workflow

## Step 1: Firmware Structure Analysis

### Initial Reconnaissance
```bash
# Identify firmware structure
binwalk firmware/release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.tdf

# Examine file header
hexdump -C firmware/release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.tdf | head -10

# Check for strings and identify components
strings firmware/release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.tdf | grep -i -E "(drobo|vxworks|wind)" | head -20
```

**Expected Output:**
- ELF binaries at offsets 0x22C and 0x303124
- VxWorks WIND kernel version 2.13 at 0xF59BFC
- TDIH header with "Marvin" target name

## Step 2: Component Extraction

### Extract Firmware Components
```bash
# From scripts/extraction/ directory
cd scripts/extraction/
python3 extract_all_components.py

# Verify extracted files in extracted/ directory
ls -la ../../extracted/
file ../../extracted/*.elf ../../extracted/*.bin
```

**Key Components:**
- `main_vxworks.elf` (3MB) - Bootloader
- `secondary.elf` (12MB) - **Main application with Drobo logic**
- `vxworks_kernel.bin` (4.6MB) - VxWorks kernel

## Step 3: Target Identification

### Search for Capacity Limits
```bash
# From scripts/analysis/ directory
cd scripts/analysis/
python3 find_patch_targets.py

# Look for the smoking gun
strings ../../extracted/secondary.elf | grep -i "2tb\|dislocation"
```

**Critical Finding:**
```
"DPM::discoverDis: >2TB drive: Setting dislocation to 2TB"
```

### Locate Binary Constants
```bash
# Search for 2TB constants in various formats
python3 -c "
constants = {
    '2TB_sectors': 4294967296,      # 0x100000000 (2TB / 512 bytes)
    '2TB_binary': 2199023255552,    # 0x20000000000 (2^41 bytes)  
    '2TB_decimal': 2000000000000,   # 2*10^12 bytes
}
for name, value in constants.items():
    print(f'{name}: 0x{value:x} ({value:,})')
"

# Find constants in binary
hexdump -C extracted/secondary.elf | grep -E "00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00|00 00 00 00 02 00 00 00"
```

## Step 4: Detailed Analysis with Ghidra

### Load in Ghidra
1. **Import:** `extracted/secondary.elf`
2. **Processor:** ARM (little endian)
3. **Auto-analyze:** Enable all options
4. **Search strings:** "DPM::discoverDis: >2TB drive"
5. **Find cross-references** to locate the comparison function

### Identify Patch Locations
Look for code patterns like:
```c
if (drive_capacity > 0x100000000) {  // 2TB in sectors
    printf("DPM::discoverDis: >2TB drive: Setting dislocation to 2TB");
    effective_capacity = 0x100000000;  // ‚Üê Patch this constant
}
```

## Step 5: Binary Patching

### Create Targeted Patch
```bash
# From scripts/patching/ directory
cd scripts/patching/
python3 patch_2tb_limit.py

# The script will:
# 1. Backup the original file to backups/
# 2. Locate 2TB constants in extracted/secondary.elf
# 3. Replace with larger limits (e.g., 32TB)
# 4. Verify the patch
```

**Manual Patching Alternative:**
```bash
# Find exact offset of 2TB constant
python3 -c "
import struct
with open('../../extracted/secondary.elf', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()
    pattern = struct.pack('<Q', 4294967296)  # 2TB sectors
    offset = data.find(pattern)
    print(f'2TB constant at: 0x{offset:x}')
"

# Patch with hexeditor or dd
# Replace 0x100000000 with 0x800000000 (32TB sectors)
```

## Step 6: Firmware Reconstruction

### Rebuild TDF Container
```bash
# Create rebuild script
cat > rebuild_tdf.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import struct

def rebuild_firmware():
    # Read original TDF
    with open('../release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.tdf', 'rb') as f:
        original = f.read()
    
    # Read patched secondary.elf
    with open('secondary.elf', 'rb') as f:
        patched = f.read()
    
    # Rebuild: header + patched_secondary + remaining_components
    before = original[:3158308]  # Before secondary.elf
    after = original[16096252:]  # After secondary.elf (VxWorks kernel)
    
    # Ensure proper padding
    padding = 16096252 - 3158308 - len(patched)
    if padding > 0:
        new_firmware = before + patched + b'\x00' * padding + after
    else:
        new_firmware = before + patched + after
    
    with open('release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.PATCHED.tdf', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(new_firmware)
    
    print(f"‚úì Created patched firmware: {len(new_firmware):,} bytes")

rebuild_firmware()
EOF

python3 rebuild_tdf.py
```

## Step 7: Verification and Testing

### Pre-Flash Verification
```bash
# Verify patched firmware structure
binwalk release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.PATCHED.tdf

# Compare with original
diff <(binwalk release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.tdf) \
     <(binwalk release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.PATCHED.tdf)

# Check strings still exist
strings release.Drobo5D3.4-2-3.PATCHED.tdf | grep -i drobo | head -5
```

### Safe Testing Protocol
1. **Backup original firmware** from device
2. **Connect TTL serial cable** for recovery access
3. **Test with spare drives only** (no important data)
4. **Monitor boot process** via serial console
5. **Verify drive detection** with >2TB drives

## Step 8: Recovery Procedures

### TTL Serial Access
```bash
# Connect TTL adapter (3.3V):
# GND -> GND
# TX -> RX (device)  
# RX -> TX (device)

# Access VxWorks console
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

# Available commands in VxWorks shell:
-> help
-> taskShow
-> driveShow
-> reboot
```

### Emergency Recovery
If device fails to boot:
1. **Power cycle** with TTL connected
2. **Interrupt boot process** (press any key during startup)
3. **Flash original firmware** via serial
4. **Use bootloader recovery mode** if available

## Tools Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
# File analysis
file firmware.bin                    # Identify file type
hexdump -C firmware.bin | head      # View hex content
strings firmware.bin | grep text    # Extract strings
binwalk -E firmware.bin             # Entropy analysis
binwalk -A firmware.bin             # Architecture detection

# Binary editing
dd if=input of=output bs=1 skip=N   # Extract at offset
python3 -c "import struct; ..."     # Pack/unpack binary data
```

### Advanced Analysis
- **Ghidra:** Complete reverse engineering platform
- **Radare2:** Command-line binary analysis
- **IDA Pro:** Commercial disassembler (if available)
- **VxHunter:** VxWorks-specific analysis scripts

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal Compliance:**
- Firmware modification may void warranty
- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities
- Respect intellectual property rights
- Consider DMCA exemptions for repair purposes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Precautions:**
- Always backup original firmware
- Test on non-production systems
- Have recovery procedures ready
- Understand the risks of firmware modification

## Expected Results

After successful patching:
- Drobo 5D3 should accept drives >2TB
- Full capacity should be recognized and usable
- BeyondRAID should function normally with larger drives
- Performance should remain consistent

**Note:** This process requires technical expertise and carries inherent risks. Proceed only if you understand the implications and have appropriate recovery methods available.
